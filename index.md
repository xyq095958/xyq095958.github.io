Hello ! Welcome to my personal website ~ 
I am a master student in Business Analytics at Columbia University, and I got my bachelorâ€™s degree in economics at University of British Columbia.
My goal as a professional is to become a Data Scientist in consulting firms, who can provide efficient data-driven business solutions to the company. I believe my academic background have brought me a proficiency in analyzing data, including using statistical knowledge and programming techniques.
My proficiency in T-SQL and Python is best illustrated by my internship at International Alliance Associates LLC. Last Summer, I conducted analysis on 1 year of customer data using T-SQL and Phyton and created a product return rate report. In the report, I offered 5 actionable suggestions for the marketing team that would lower the product return rate.
